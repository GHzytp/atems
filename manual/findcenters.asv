function center = findcenters(x,y,a,b)
%FINDCENTERS Computes the intersection of the two lines formed by
%coordinates given by x,y,a,b vectors
%   Utilizes derived formulae to compute the intersection of the linear
%   functions composed of the provided parameters.  Returns center: a
%   vector of form [x,y] to represent the coordinates of the center.

x1 = x(1);
x2 = x(2);
y1 = y(1);
y2 = y(2
