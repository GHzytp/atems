## UBC-TEM-analysis

This program contains several methods of characterizing aggregates from
TEM images, including evaluating the aggregate projected area, perimeter,
and primary particle diameter.


### Description and instructions

The software contains MATLAB designed to compare multiple
methods of analyzing TEM images of aggregates. These include the
pair correlation method (PCM), Kook, and manual methods.

This code was primarily compiled by Timothy A. Sipkens while at the
University of British Columbia (UBC), who can be emailed at
[tsipkens@mail.ubc.ca](mailto:tsipkens@mail.ubc.ca). The code
itself was compiled from various sources and features code written by
several individuals at UBC, including Yeshun (Samuel) Ma, Ramin Dastanpour,
Yiling Kang, Una Trivanovich, and Steven Rogak, among others.

Also featured is the original MATLAB code of Kook et al.
([https://doi.org/10.4271/2015-01-1991](https://doi.org/10.4271/2015-01-1991)),
modified slightly to accommodate the expected inputs and outputs common
to the other functions, and a modification thereof by Ramin Dastanpour
and Yiling Kang.

The PCM code is adapted from the work of Dastanpour et al.
([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.03.027](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.03.027)).
